# Movie_Segmentation_using_Datamining

An Unsupervised ML Capstone Project Problem Statement: This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. We need to do:

1.Exploratory Data Analysis.
2.Understanding what type of content is available in different countries.
3.Is Netflix increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years?
4.Clustering similar content by matching text-based features.
